- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
I've used a lot of inheritance before, and it still stands as probably my single favorite thing in programming as a whole. It can be used in so many different ways and is so incredibly powerful once you get the hang of it.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Write the javadoc comments as you go. Not for ease of understanding as you go (although that helps too) but mainly so that you don't need to spend a night just writing comments on all of the different methods all at once.
